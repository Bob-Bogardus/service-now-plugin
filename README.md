# ServiceNow API Jenkins Plugin

This is a Jenkins plugin that allows a workflow step that extends the `http_request` plugin
to automatically build API requests for the ServiceNow API and return appropriately parsed
values based on the type of API called.

It defines a set of configuration values that can be used to identify the ServiceNow instance
information and configure the API requests.
